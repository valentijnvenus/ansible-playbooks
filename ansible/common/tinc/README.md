# tinc

Example playbook for deploying a mesh network on a number of hosts.

---

There are numerous ways this can be achieved, but for the sake of simplicity each node will be identified via the `vpn_ip` host var.

**Warning** To use this playbook you will need to install `ipaddr()` filter (not required on remote hosts):

```sh
$ pip install netaddr
```

Here's an example inventory file for the default `10.10.1.0/24` network:

```ini
1.1.1.1 vpn_ip=10.10.1.10
8.8.8.8 vpn_ip=10.10.1.20
8.8.4.4 vpn_ip=10.10.1.30
```

This will automatically create a mesh network between all hosts on which the play is running on.

Other things to be aware of:

- Inventory groups are supported by changing the `hosts: all` to `hosts: <my_inventory_group>` in the example playbook below
- Make sure port 655 can be reached on TCP and UDP - tinc uses them to establish a connection
- By default, a mesh network with a name of `mytinc` and a network `10.10.1.0/24` will be created
- tinc daemon can be started/stopped: `service tinc@mytinc start`

## How does it work?

Each playbook run generates new SSH keys for every node, so it can also be easily used to rotate SSH keys. Generally it works like this:

- Create temporary build folder
- Provision each node
- Synchronize host configurations
- Delete build folder

**Create temporary build folder** - will keep all SSH keys and daemon configs, so that later we can distribute public keys to all hosts.

**Provision each node** - installs tinc server, uploads daemon configuration files and private SSH key used to secure communication between the nodes.

**Synchronize host configurations** - uploads tinc host configuration files to all nodes. this file has the node ip, subnet configuration and itâ€™s public key.

**Delete build folder** - deletes temporary build root, removing all traces of generated SSH keys.

## Troubleshooting network configuration

To start tinc in debug mode run:

```sh
$ tincd -n <network_name> -D
```

Hitting `Ctrl + c` will increase the log level, so you can see all the messages between the two servers. To exit, hit `Ctrl + \`.

## Example playbook

```yml
---
# Deploys tinc VPN

- name: Create build directory
  hosts: 127.0.0.1
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Create build directory
      tempfile: state=directory suffix=_tinc
      register: build_dir
    - name: Make it available to other plays
      set_fact: build_dir="{{ build_dir.path }}"
    - debug:
        msg: "Build root: {{ build_dir }}"

- name: Provision tinc server
  hosts: all  # alternatively, change this to your inventory group
  vars:
    tinc_build_root: "{{ hostvars['localhost']['build_dir'] }}"
  roles:
    - tinc

- name: Cleanup
  hosts: 127.0.0.1
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Delete the build folder
      file: state=absent path="{{ hostvars['localhost']['build_dir'] }}/"
```

# The subnet which this tinc daemon will serve
#
# Multiple subnet lines can be specified for each daemon. Subnets can either be
# single MAC, IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, in which case a subnet consisting of only
# that single address is assumed, or they can be a # IPv4 or IPv6 network
# address with a prefixlength. For example, IPv4 subnets must be in a form like
# 192.168.1.0/24, where 192.168.1.0 is the network address and 24 is the number
# of bits set in the netmask. Note that subnets like 192.168.1.1/24 are invalid!
